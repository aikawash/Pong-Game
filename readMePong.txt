REFLECTION: This programming assignment took about 5 hours spread out ouver about 4 days to finish. I initially thought it was hard, but when I sat down and though about it I didn't have too much trouble, except for some parts, which I went to you about. I think the hardest problem I encountered was the paddles going off screen. This was solved by using an if statement to limit the pixel distance the paddles could move up and down.
